## Fixing EleventyConfig TypeScript Error (1/28/2025, 10:48:17 AM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Module '"@11ty/eleventy"' has no exported member 'EleventyConfig'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The type definition for `EleventyConfig` should be imported from `@11ty/eleventy/src/UserConfig` instead. Here's the fix:

```typescript:eleventy.config.ts
// existing code...
import { UserConfig } from "@11ty/eleventy/src/UserConfig"

export default function (eleventyConfig: UserConfig) {
// existing code...
```

This change imports the correct type definition while maintaining the same functionality. The rest of your configuration file can remain unchanged.

This error indicates that Eleventy can't find the `_includes` directory. You need to create the directory structure that matches your Eleventy configuration. Based on your config, you need to create these directories under `src`:

```bash
src/
  ├── _includes/
  ├── _layouts/
  └── _data/
```

You can create these directories with this command:

```bash
mkdir -p src/_includes src/_layouts src/_data
```

The error occurs because your Eleventy config specifies these directories in the configuration, but they don't exist in your project yet. Creating them should resolve the error and allow Eleventy to serve your site properly.

Does anything need to be in the _includes folder? It already exists.

Looking at your file structure, you have `_layouts` but not `_includes`. In your `eleventy.config.ts`, you're specifying both directories separately. Since you're using `base.njk` in the `_layouts` directory, you should modify the config to match your actual structure.

Here's the fix:

```typescript:eleventy.config.ts
// ... existing code ...
  return {
    dir: {
      input: "src",
      output: "_site",
      // Remove includes since you're using _layouts
      layouts: "_layouts",
      data: "_data",
    },
    // ... existing code ...
  }
```

This change removes the `includes` directory from the config since you're already using `_layouts` for your templates. The `base.njk` in your `_layouts` directory should be sufficient for your template needs.

If you do want to keep both directories, you'll need to create the `src/_includes` directory and move any partial templates (like headers, footers, navigation) into it, while keeping full page layouts in `_layouts`.

What is the difference between _includes and _layouts in Eleventy?

_**Assistant**_



In Eleventy, `_includes` and `_layouts` serve different but related purposes:

`_layouts`:
- Used for full page templates/layouts
- Define the overall structure of your pages
- Usually contain the main HTML structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.)
- Example: `base.njk` that defines how all your pages should look

`_includes`:
- Used for partial templates/components
- Smaller, reusable pieces of content
- Can be included within layouts or other templates
- Examples: navigation bars, footers, sidebars, article cards

Here's a practical example:

```njk:src/_layouts/base.njk
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
    {% include "nav.njk" %}
    <main>
        {{ content | safe }}
    </main>
    {% include "footer.njk" %}
</body>
</html>
```

```njk:src/_includes/nav.njk
<nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
</nav>
```

In this example:
- `base.njk` is a layout that defines the page structure
- `nav.njk` is an include that can be reused across different layouts
- The layout uses the include with `{% include "nav.njk" %}`

For your current setup, if you're only using full page layouts, you might not need `_includes`. But if you start breaking your site into reusable components, you'll want to use the `_includes` directory.

I notice from your file structure that your layouts are in `src/_includes/_layouts/`, but in your Eleventy config they're expected to be in `src/_layouts/`. This mismatch is causing the error. Let's fix the config to match your actual directory structure:

```typescript:eleventy.config.ts
// ... existing code ...
  return {
    dir: {
      input: "src",
      output: "_site",
      includes: "_includes",
      layouts: "_includes/_layouts",  // Update path to match your structure
      data: "_data",
    },
    // ... existing code ...
  }
```

This change points Eleventy to the correct location of your layout files. Your layouts are nested inside the `_includes` directory, so we need to specify the full path `_includes/_layouts` in the config.

Alternatively, if you prefer to follow Eleventy's conventional structure, you could move your layout files from `src/_includes/_layouts/` to `src/_layouts/`. Either approach will work, but you need to make sure the config matches your actual directory structure.
