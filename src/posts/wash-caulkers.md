## Federal Workers Strike for Better Conditions

### A History of Labor Action

African Americans have participated in labor actions since before the Civil War. In the early nineteenth century, African Americans played a dominant role in the caulking trade, and in 1835, organized a strike at the Washington, D.C. Navy Yard. Caulking was of great importance in shipbuilding, for a ship was not fit for service unless it was caulked to prevent leaking. This was the first strike of federal civilian employees.

### Unity

The strike was an example of early inter-racial worker solidarity. White carpenters and Black caulkers who worked together at Washington Navy Yard went on strike together. They advocated to reduce the twelve-hour workday to ten hours, a raise in wages (which were subject to daily, dramatic fluctuations), and to lift the restriction on workers bringing their lunch to work and enjoying a lunch break during work hours.

### The Snow Riot

The strike failed in its objectives for two reasons: the Secretary of the Navy refused to change the shipyard working hours, and the outbreak of the Snow Riot.

The Snow Riot was a riot and lynch mob of whites who attacked free Blacks in Washington, D.C. The riot was named after Beverly Snow's Epicurean Eating House, a restaurant owned by Beverly Snow, a free man of mixed parentage, that offered sophisticated and healthy food using the slogan "Health Bought Cheap."

The riot began because of unsubstantiated news that Anna Maria Thornton (a white socialite) was reportedly assaulted by a young ax-wielding Negro slave in her F Street home in August 1835. This accusation inflamed frustrations by whites who were participating in the strike and stoked existing tensions whites felt about the teaching of Abolitionism. After destroying the restaurant, the mob destroyed schools, churches, and businesses in the Black community. The riot continued for days in the nation's capital, and it was not until President Andrew Jackson ordered U.S. Marines to suppress the rioters.
