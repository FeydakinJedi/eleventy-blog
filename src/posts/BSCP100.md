## A milestone for Freed Americans

### Overview

The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP) was a labor union organized by African American employees of the Pullman Company in August 1925 and led by [A. Philip Randolph](https://aflcio.org/about/history/labor-history-people/asa-philip-randolph) and [Milton P. Webster](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/webster-milton-p-1887-1965/). Over the next twelve years, the BSCP fought a three-front battle against the Pullman Company, the American Federation of Labor, and the anti-union, pro-Pullman sentiments of the black community. Largely successful on each front, the BCSP is a significant institution in both the labor and civil rights history of the twentieth century United States.

### The Need for Action

The members of the BSCP were porters employed by the Pullman Palace Car Company, which was established by George Pullman in 1867 and became the Pullman Company in 1900. The company was the largest employer of African Americans, purposefully hiring formerly enslaved people, believing that former slaves would be fully acclimated to long work hours and servitude.

Sleeping car porters shined shoes, made up the beds, woke passengers, and provided other services to ensure a comfortable trip. African Americans were not allowed to fill higher paying and better regarded jobs such as conductors. The porters endured poor working conditions. At least 400 hours were required each month to earn their full pay. In comparison to other company roles, porters were paid the lowest salary and had to cater to the passengers’ every whim to earn tips. They were expected to pay for their uniforms, meals, and sleeping quarters while traveling. Porters were dehumanized and called racial slurs, “boy,” or “George,” which mimicked the practice of referring to enslaved people by the name of their owner. In this case, addressing a porter as “George” implied that he was the property of George Pullman.

### Dignity for Black People is a Radical idea

> Equality is the heart and essence of democracy, freedom, and justice, equality of opportunity in industry, in labor unions, schools and colleges, government, politics, and before the law. There must be no dual standards of justice, no dual rights, privileges, duties, or responsibilities of citizenship. No dual forms of freedom.

> — A. Philip Randolph

Civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph was chosen to be the leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Because he was not employed by the Pullman Company, unionizing would not cost him his job. Randolph was known for being an advocate for workers' rights and edited a socialist magazine, [The Messenger](https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/pubs/messenger/index.htm), which he used to raise awareness of the labor movement.

### Labor and the Civil Rights Movement

The Sleeping Car Porters and UAW were among the first supporters of the new Southern Christian Leadership Conference. They also supported the Woolworth counter sit-ins by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Freedom Rides organized by the Congress of Racial Equality in the summer of 1961. Randolph and other black trade unionists helped plan, organize, and fund King’s 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where he delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech.

In their commitments and vision, these black trade unionists linked the priorities and interests of the labor movement with demands for racial equality. John Kennedy recognized that labor had been crucial to winning the presidency in 1960 and created a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that would be true to its original mission. His NLRB restricted anti-union propaganda at the workplace, allowed picketing, increased the penalties for violating labor law, and banned employer lockouts as an “unfair labor practice.” Most importantly, it ruled that if a majority of workers signed a card saying they wanted to join a union, the union would be recognized.

### Into the Modern Day

In 1978, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters merged into a larger union called the Brotherhood of Railway, Airline, Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees (BRAC). This union still exists today as the Transportation Communications Union/IAM. This union represents around 35,000 people who mainly work in the railroad industry.
